# super-learner
super learner model implemented in the prediction of corrosion rate of 3C steel
This supervised learning model is made up of extra gradient boosting model,
lasso, poly kernel of svr, linear and ridge regression. This models were selected
to make up the architecture of the super learner by a selection framework which also
optimized them enough to be plugged straight into the super learner.
